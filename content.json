Axel D - defended poorly most of the match, but redeemed himself with a match-tying header. Poch - had an average tactical set-up and first half, but redeemed himself by preparing a strong counter for Brentford’s inevitable tactical switches in the second half. let us all down by doing FA in the 2nd half.] ⟩⟩⟩ twosweet201：杰哥有能力，但貌似只要他一有时间思考，他就认为自己做不到。 [Nico can finish but it seems like the moment he has a tenth of a second to think about he mentally can’t do it.] ⟩⟩⟩⟩ hipcheck23：也许吧，不过我也认为他对时机的判断不准确。他很难在正确的时间和正确的位置射门或者完成第一脚触球。 [Perhaps, although I also thinks he just has little clue about timing. He struggles to get into the right space at the right time to shoot or take the first touch.] ⟩⟩⟩⟩ Environmental_You_85：他需要停止思考，然后狂按射门键。 [He needs to stop thinking and just shoot like madman] —————————————————————————— ⟩ RefanRes：他需要在单刀这方面有所改进，而且他自己肯定也知道。我知道他那些令人印象深刻的浪费机会都是赶上了他的左脚，所以他需要在这方面更努力一点。 但你也能看到他有多想进球。即使几分钟后，他仍旧双手抱头，为自己没能完成得分而感到沮丧。他的有点就在于他的精神足够坚韧，心态也在不断成长，所以他会不停地去尝试，而今天付出就获得了回报。他同样也很有拼劲，可以给对方的防守制造很多问题，牵扯他们的防线。他只是需要一点打磨。 [One on ones like this are an area of his game he needs to work on and he certainly knows it. I think the most memorable missed chances have been on his left foot too so that could maybe use some work. You can see how much he wants it though. Even a couple of mins later he was hands to his head looking frustrated he didn’t score it. The good thing about him is he has the mental resilience and growth mindset to just keep trying and today that paid off. He also battles hard enough to cause opposition defences plenty of problems enough to stretch them. He just needs some polish.] —————————————————————————— ⟩ Baisabeast：可能越位了，而且几分钟之后他也进球了。但没事，继续抱怨吧。 [It was likely offside and he scored just minutes later. But sure, go complain] ⟩⟩ GME_alt_Center：是的，它可能会被判越位，我们至少得到了一个角球。 但这个结果还是很令人遗憾。 [Yeah, it would have been ruled out. At least we got a corner instead. But still, a tragic finish.] ⟩⟩ WY-8：当我们对一个前锋连空门都打不进这种情况都不感到惊讶了，也许这不是我们应该押宝的前锋。 [When a striker can’t finish an open goal, and we’re all not surprised, perhaps this isn’t the striker we should be investing in.] ⟩⟩ Pendulum122：你居然认为这个水平是可以的😹。 [You think this level is ok😹] ⟩⟩ _off_piste_：不管越位与否，几分钟你的进球能弥补错失的这次绝佳机会吗？我们本可以在短时间内连入两球。 [Regardless of the offsides you scoring minutes later makes up for missing a golden opportunity? WTF? We are allowed to score two goals in quick succession.] —————————————————————————— ⟩ CK-Prime：无论如何他都应该把这球踢进去，各位现在对切尔西的标准真的太低了。 [He should be scoring regardless, everyone’s standards now for this club are honestly in the toilet] ⟩⟩ highonfire123：球员们经常错失绝佳机会。如果他能弥补这一点，就像他这场比赛一样，那就没什么大不了的。提莫错失了这种机会，而且也没有进头球。芒特踢出最佳表现的那个赛季，也错失过空门。这种事情就是会发生。 [Players miss sitters all the time. If he makes up for it, like he did, then it’s not a big deal. Werner misses this shot and doesn’t score the header. Mount in his best seasons for us also missed open nets. It happens.] —————————————————————————— ⟩ endmoe：如果你看到是杰哥在拿球，那你就应该知道结果了。 [It is Nicholas Jackson with the ball.

The other managers are smarter than Poch and I won’t hear otherwise. No one should be happy with 1 point against a team that has lost 5 of 6 and sits 16th.] ⟩⟩ hornyucsdstudent：恩佐踢左边锋，波嗨想的什么天才战术？ [Enzo at LW warra tactics by Porch🔥🔥] ⟩⟩⟩ osalahudeen：这很好的说明了今天的问题。我们看到了多少次，恩佐在进攻三区，凯赛多在思考人生？说实话，我仍然相信评论区的有些兄弟们都比波嗨懂技战术。 [This sums everything wrong about today. How many times have we been riled seeing Enzo in the attacking third while Caicedo is left all alone to figure it out himself? I still believe there are some folks here who is better than Poch at coaching tactically tbh.] ⟩⟩ C-3pee0：其他对手总会调整他们的战术来反制波切蒂诺在上半场的安排。而波切蒂诺只会坐在那里，按着他们主导比赛，直到70分钟或者对手进球。他的教练模式惊为天人。 [Other team will ALWAYS tweak their tactics to nullify whatever Poch was doing in the first half. But Poch just sits there and allows them to dictate the game either until the 70th minute or until they score. His game management is shocking. ] ⟩⟩⟩ Baisabeast：他整个生涯就是这个风格，在这方面他永远不会改善。 [It’s been a theme throughout his career and he will never ever improve in this aspect] ⟩⟩ FantasticTangtastic：甚至不是布伦特福德最强的阵容哈哈哈哈。 [It wasn’t even Brentfords strongest team lol] ⟩⟩⟩ Headlesshorsman02：后防全是替补，真的太尴尬了。 [That was all their backups in the back line truly embarrassing] ⟩⟩ Just_Some_Cool_Guy：没有教练可能都比这个什么都不会的骗子好。 [Literally be better off with no manager than this clueless fraud] ⟩⟩ Shogim：过去两个赛季面对布伦特福德只拿到两分。我不敢相信我们有多差。 [Thats two points gained from Brentford over the last two seasons. I cant believe how bad we are.] ⟩⟩ TheBoyKane2424：确实，他的战术就不能和这个级别的比赛匹配。 [Exactly…he’s just not up to it tactically at this level anymore] ⟩⟩ Headlesshorsman02：他们开局也比我们好。 [They also start better then us as well] —————————————————————————— ⟩ iKnowWhoIamWhoRu：我认为车迷们应该保持积极的态度。比如说我，我就非常确信波切蒂诺完全不知道自己在干什么。 [I think fans just need to stay positive. For example, I’m positive that Poch has no clue wtf he’s doing] ⟩⟩ DarnellLaqavius：芜湖！我现在也是一个积极的车迷了。我非常确信我们是一坨构式。 [Love it. I’m now officially a positive fan. Positive that we’re fucking shite.] ⟩⟩⟩ DynamiteDuck：我确信我们的老板普通且自信，并且波切蒂诺在任的每一天都会不停地证明这一点。 [I’m positive these owners are completely complacent with mediocrity and prove it more every day poch is still around] —————————————————————————— ⟩ Traditional_Ship4797：感觉就是一场失败。 [Felt like a loss] ⟩⟩ fap4jesus：在本赛季的这个节点，基本上就是这样。 [pretty much is at this point in the season.] ⟩⟩ Headlesshorsman02：是的，这就是一场失败，在他们整条首发防线都缺席的情况下，我们本应该拿到一场彻彻底底的胜利。 [It is one, there is no way we shouldn’t have thrashed brentford today they are missing their whole defense] ⟩⟩ iiDommm：这场比赛之前，布伦特福德在大概36分中只拿到了6分，这确实是一场失败。 [Brentford were 6 points out of a possible 36 before this game. It is a loss] ⟩⟩ EmperorTMing：布伦特福德在过去的14场比赛里输掉了11场，和这种状态的球队打平几乎就是输球。 [Brentford have lost 11 of their last 14. Drawing against a team in this form may as well be a loss.] ⟩⟩ Calm_Fail_5824：这就是一场失败哈哈哈哈。 [it is a loss lmao] —————————————————————————— ⟩ lukeisfluke：我们的防守球员显然对足球过敏。 [Our defenders are allergic to the ball apparently.] ⟩⟩ Older-Is-Better：他们就让球搁那弹，也不知道怎么去判断高空球的落点，他们甚至不会用胸部停球。 [They let balls bounce, they can’t track balls in the air (poor spacial awareness), and they don’t know chest-to-feet.] ⟩⟩ xStealthxUk：我对人们说“蒂亚戈是我们最大的问题”这种说法非常嗤之以鼻。欢迎来到中后卫没有经验的世界。查洛巴比灾厄迪萨西和热土豆科尔威尔都要好得多。讽刺的是他会被卖掉，而其他笨蛋却会被留下。 还有，我确信7252一定签了一场比赛不能铲球超过两次的合同，我看他比赛的时候完全不愿意出脚，他那边的防守简直下头，我真的非常担心。 我也受够了这些球员在比赛的一些常规时刻对比赛没有控制力……没有领袖，没有经验，这就是你会得到的结果。 一团乱麻。 [I laughed when ppl said Thiago was our biggest issue. Welcome to a world with no experienced Centre backs. Chalobah was a mile ahead of both Disasi the disaster and Mr hot potato Colwill. Ironically Trev will get sold and we keep these oafs. And Chilly must have a clause in his contract that says he cant tackle more than twice in a game cos the guy simply refuses to put a foot and everythin comes down that side worries me to no end. Sick of the complete lack of control these players have in the most basic of moments…. no leaders, no experience this is what you get. Shambolic] ⟩⟩⟩ pencilman123：戚薇的表现没有借口，但我认为他在反复的伤病中有了心理障碍。我不是说我们需要额外照顾他，但他需要人给他自信，让他解放自己。可惜我们现在的队伍没有这样的能力。 [Chilly’s performance has no excuses, but i think he has this mental block of the injury and the ones after that big one. Not saying he needs to be babysitted but he needs someone to give him confidence and come out of his shell. Our current lot aint that.] —————————————————————————— ⟩ PeeCanManzzer：斯特林不是在过人，他是在祈祷他能过人。 [Does Sterling have it in him to not dribble right at multiple people and just pray he gets through?] ⟩⟩ Older-Is-Better：他就过不了。 [No, he does not.] ⟩⟩ gdewulf：我真的从来没有这样讨厌过一个球员。我发自内心地认为他毁了球队。他确实有一些好的品质，但这些好的一面，被他不好的一面完全压制了，以至于我根本不在于他那些好的地方。他破坏了球队的流畅性，球场上的化学反应。今天夏天必须卖掉他，我真的不敢相信他居然还能得到上场时间。 [I have never disliked a player more. I honestly truly believe that he ruins the team. He has some positive qualities, but those are so heavily outweighed by his negatives that they don’t even matter. He ruins any flow, any on field chemistry. He needs to be sold this summer. I can’t even believe he still gets minutes.] ⟩⟩ FantasticTangtastic：我就没见过工资和给球迷带去的挫败感是成正比的球员。 [There is just nobody else in the world that has such high wages and a high level of frustration.] ⟩⟩ TheBoyKane2424：他很烂。 [He sucks] —————————————————————————— ⟩ Djent_Reznor1：波切蒂诺需要立马走，我们真的太差了。 [He has to go. We’re just so so bad.] ⟩⟩ hipcheck23：阵容：还不错；开场战术：还不错；下半场调整：几乎让我们输掉比赛。为什么这么多俱乐部在面对我们的时候能做出调整，而我们却做不到？真正的问题是：波切蒂诺为什么如此固执地认为不断地重复同样的事情是正确的？ [Lineup: passable. Starting tactics: passable. Second half adjustments: nearly lost us the match. How is it that most clubs make adjustments against us, but we can’t do the same? And the real question is: how does Poch think it’s okay to continually just run the same thing back when they keep doing that?] ⟩⟩⟩ TitanX11：猜猜中场休息时他会怎么说？“踢得好孩子们，下半场继续这样踢”，我是一点战术调整都看不到。 [What does he tell them at half time? Good job boys, play football again in the second half too. I don’t see any adjustments in tactics.] ⟩⟩⟩⟩ hipcheck23：“你们做得很棒，现在我们只需要拖时间然后等点球” [“You’re doing great, let’s take it down a notch and wait for pens!”] ⟩⟩ fap4jesus：我真的不知道我们为什么在积分榜上还能这么靠前。 [i honestly dont understand how we are so high up in the table] ⟩⟩⟩ Just_Some_Cool_Guy：因为虽然媒体会跟你说一些事，但我们确实有很多优秀的球员。只是这个没用的教练在拖后腿。 [Because despite what the media will tell you, we’ve actually got a lot of quality in the squad just this useless manager is holding everyone back] ⟩⟩⟩ Hannibal09：因为球队里有一些优质的球员。普通球迷从推上获得信息，而推上的共识是讨厌我们的球员，所以他们也会跟着讨厌我们的球员。 这支球队只要能够被好好的指导和训练，一定会很轻松地进入前六。 [Because there are some quality players in this team. The regular fan gets their information from Twitter where the herd mentality is to hate our players so they side along. This team is easily a top 6 team if coached and trained well] ⟩⟩⟩ Noctius：我们的球队非常有天赋。我们是否再买球员上花费过多了？当然，但是我们的阵容同样也很好，所以我们的表现比过去要好得多，很多时候是球员的能力让我们取得了一些成绩。对这些球员不公正和不成比例的批评，以及为了捍卫和掩盖教练的失职而将他们置于被指责和被抛弃的境地，是很不公正的。 [We have a really good and talented squad. Did we overspend on a lot of these players? Absolutely but what we have is still good enough to be a lot better than we have been and it’s usually their ability that drags us to the few results we get. It’s criminal that these players are unfairly and disproportionately criticised and thrown under the bus to defend and cover for this manager’s failings.] —————————————————————————— ⟩ Luberino_Brochacho：斯特林知道怎么做两件事：第一，在禁区里进行不必要的触球；第二，冒充罗纳尔多。 [Sterling knows how to do 2 things 1.Take unnecessary touches in the box. 2.Dribble straight at defenders like he’s prime Ronaldo.] ⟩⟩ Older-Is-Better：第三，在球场上散步。 [3.Stroll around the pitch.] ⟩⟩⟩ hockeyholloway89：第四，模仿暴龙。 [T-Rex impersonations] —————————————————————————— ⟩ Look_at_that_D0g：每周最差劲的时候。 [Worst part of my week every week] ⟩⟩ brightcrayon92：至少你已经渡过这周最糟糕的部分了，接下来你就可以享受剩下的一周了。而我，我对切尔西的比赛以及开摆了。 [At least you get the worst out of the way quickly to enjoy the rest of your week. Personally I’m not at the stage to let chelsea games ruin my mood anymore] ⟩⟩⟩ DarnellLaqavius：我现在的状态就是看着我们的比赛，骂球员跟狗屎一样，然后回到现实享受生活。 [I watch us, call us dogshit and go back to enjoying my life.] —————————————————————————— ⟩ rhaegaryen：什么时候会出现第一篇“相信过程”的帖子？三十分钟后还是三十分钟内？ [How long til the first ‘trust the process’ post? Over&#x2F;under 30 minutes?] ⟩⟩ darthrector：给一个小时吧，把这些文章打出来可要花一点时间呢。 [Takes some time to type out the essays give it an hour] ⟩⟩⟩ RonSwanson1081：“不要消极！支持小伙子们！” [“No negativity! Support the lads”] ⟩⟩⟩⟩ DarnellLaqavius：这是一支年轻的球队，一群年轻的球员，只要给他们4-5年时间，我们就能回到联赛的前半段了！ 不可能给一个教练五年时间才能让我们看到球队的进步。我们从来没有过一个新教练带的更差的时候。 [It’s a young team with young players they just need like 4-5 years to finish top half!! It’s impossible for a manager to see any improvement until at least 5 years. Never in our history has a new manager made any improvement.] ⟩⟩ criminal-tango44：只要上传了比赛的高光集锦，我就不相信那些“消极”的抱怨者真的看过这场糟糕透顶的比赛。 [As soon as the highlights get uploaded. I refuse to believe anyone that whines about “negativity” actually watches this horrible fucking football] ⟩⟩ SexoFernanj：《这个过程很艰难，如果你不相信它，那就闭嘴滚蛋》，u&#x2F;Odd-Incident3980，你正在起草你的下一篇文章吗？ [“The process is tough but if you don’t trust it then shrink back and shut your mouth” u&#x2F;Odd-Incident3980, you drafting your next essay?] —————————————————————————— END"},{"title":"Chelsea-Reddit-Comment-vsLeedsUnited-240229","date":"2024-02-29T04:22:36.000Z","path":"2024/02/29/Chelsea-Reddit-Comment-vsLeedsUnited-240229/","text":"Post-Match Thread: Chelsea (3) vs (2) Leeds United | English FA Cup 阅读提醒： “|”代表评论层级，“|”代表这是第一层评论，“| |”代表这是第二层评论，即回复上一层评论，以此类推。 用“—–”来区分楼层。 括号里是评论原文。 | Kagoshima_Luke：我的小心愿就是我们能连胜然后赢得足总杯，然后以此进入欧战。然后再连胜赢得欧联。然后赢超级杯。这点小心愿不算过分吧。（My small ask is that we string together the few victories needed to grab this FA cup and gain entry to Europe. Then, string some wins together to capture Europa. Then win the Super Cup. Not much to ask, really.） | | SiRex750：就跟吃豆子土司一样简单。（Simple as beans on toast） | | | 323835：这得连续赢多少场啊？（How long is a peice of string?） | alex_song：虽然这赛季跟屎一样，但包括康纳在内的一些球员仍然值得我们的掌声，他们没有崩溃，没有放弃这个赛季，即使我们今年经历了如此多的动荡。 这种韧性绝对是一个好的迹象，我们需要一个合适的教练帮我们重新站起来。（For as shit as this season has been, some of the boys, including Connor, deserve to be given their flowers for not completely crumbling and giving up on the season after we’ve been through so much turmoil this year. It’s definitely a good sign of resilience that we can build off with a proper manager） | hipcheck23：今晚最大的赢家：彼得罗维奇。（The big winner tonight: Petro.） | polyvolcanus：康纳加拉格尔做的很棒。（Conor Gallagher is a stud.） | CuisinFart：非常高兴看到加拉格尔、穆德里克和杰克逊进球，他们需要建立这种自信。 凯赛多也踢得非常好。尤其是在星期天踢了120分钟的比赛之后。如果不是刚刚结束了上一场比赛，我们不会踢得这么艰难。（So happy that Gallagher, Mudryk and Jackson scored, build on that confidence. Thought Caicedo played really well too overall. Especially after playing 120 plus minutes on Sunday. I think if we didn’t just come off that last game, this wouldn’t have been as close as it was） | wm_1176：一个知道自己即将回到替补席的球员应有的表情。（The face of a man who knows he’s heading back to the bench） | | DM1LLS：虽然每个进球都不是他的责任，但我仍然认为他应该去替补席，因为彼德罗维奇表现非常好。 在比赛最开始时，吉尔克里斯特已经快用身体卡住位置了，但他还是冒失地出击了。整体表现很难评。（I think he should go to the bench because Petrovic has been playing well but neither goal was his fault. He did make a questionable play coming off his line in the beginning when Gilchrist “appeared” to have bodied his defender but overall an ehhhh performance.） | | | wm_1176：是的，那个进球并不是他的错，但他不能每次传球都像屎一样。说实在的，波切蒂诺给他机会是正确的，每个好的教练都应该这样做，但是对阵小蜜蜂，彼德罗维奇值得首发。（Yeah, the goals weren’t really his fault, but he can’t pass for shit. Honestly was fine with Poch giving him a shot, it’s what good managers should do with their keepers, but Petrovic deserved the spot against Brentford） | epicmarc：当我们输的时候，人们会说“他们有两亿中场”，当我们赢了，他们会把最佳球员给到输球方，并说“不要忘了，他们对阵的是两亿中场”（Commentators when we lose: “Don’t forget, they spent £200m on this midfield”. Commentators when we win and they give POTM to the losing side: “Don’t forget, he was up against a £200m midfield”） | | dragowout：我真的受够了人们一直说我们在我们阵容上怎么怎么花钱了，你就不能说点其他的吗？（Im getting so fucking tired of commentators saying how much we’ve spend on our squad, like dude can’t you come up with something else for once.） | | | hipcheck23：我看的另一个转播台。在我家和我一起看的说：“为什么他们突然这么支持切尔西？” 我就回他，“他们并不支持切尔西，他们是中立的。我们只是太常听到对切尔西有偏见的评价了。”（I was on a different broadcast. Someone in my house actually said, “Why are they being so pro-Chelsea all of a sudden?” I responded with, “They’re not. They’re being neutral. We’re just so used to hearing nonstop bias.”） | DarnellLaqavius：下一轮踢莱斯特，算上过去的十轮，我们抽到了6次低级别联赛的对手。 温布尔登、布莱克本、布莱顿、纽卡、米堡、利物浦。 普雷斯顿、维拉、利兹、莱斯特。 甚至每一次都还在主场。 所以我们每个杯赛看起来还不错也可以解释了。（Leicester next round, so out of 10 cup ties, we’ve drawn lower league sides 6 times.Wimbledon, Blackburn, Brighton, Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Liverpool.Preston, Villa, Leeds, Leicester.Every single draw at home too.Helps explain our cup runs a little.） | | OliwierCR：我们值得这些运气，毕竟上赛季签运那么差。（Deserved some luck after last season’s draws） | | | sparklingoverstill：哈哈哈，是的。但是说实话，去年就算我们签运好，也不会走太远。（lol absolutely. But to be fair we weren’t going anywhere with the team we had last year） | mrsoawk：凯赛多每场比赛都在默默地完成，并且很好地完成他的工作。（Caicedo silently excelling at his role each game.） | | Mooming22：他平衡能力很强。虽然总是被左推右挤的，但他总是能拿住球，并且转移球。（Insane balance, he would get knocked left and right but keep the ball and move it along） | | Clean_Possession_844：我非常同意。他可以说是我们这赛季表现最好的球员之一。一开始进入状态很慢，甚至很差。但是现在真的很不错。恩佐和凯赛多之间的配合也越来越默契了。（Absolutely, has been one of our best players this season, started slow and even bad but now very good performance. The understanding between Enzo and Caicedo has gotten a lot better too） | | staffkiwi：他像只章鱼。（Dude is an octopus） | wm_1176：我们会赢下莱斯特，然后在半决赛对阵赢下狼队的考文垂，最后在决赛输给利物浦。（We’re gonna win against Leicester, get Coventry in the semi-finals after they manage to beat wolves, then lose in the final to Liverpool） | | Spanswick77：那场比赛可能是克洛普的最后一场比赛吗？很愿意看到在他的告别赛出点意外。（Would that potentially be Klopp’s last game? Would love to piss on his farewell parade.） | | | cen3h：我们不可能赢的哈哈哈。（No way we would be winning that lol） | Sure_Explanation2254：换个口味，不再被绝杀或绝平，而是我们绝杀。（Nice to score a late goal rather than concede one for a change. ） | SnooHobbies7676：对阵莱斯特不会轻松。但说实在的，对阵谁有轻松过？（Against Leicester next. This is not gonna be easy. But then again, when have it been easy for us?） | | itsmebobbylol：为什么不能每周都踢热刺呢？（why cant we play spurs every week） | hipcheck23：好像没有太多人说穆德里克去踢十号位了。他第一脚触球很烂，但是他的传球，他的移动，他的速度，确实起到了作用。（Not many mentioning the transformative match by Misha at the 10. His first touch was generally poor, but his passing was surprisingly lively, his movement was pretty good, and his pace was actually a factor.） | Banged_by_bumrah：我讨厌首发那些根本就不会出球的出球型门将。（I hate when a goalkeeper who starts because they are good on the ball aren’t actually good on the ball） | | Business-Conflict435：这是这场比赛最重要的收获，彼得维奇是无可争议的首发门将。（That’s the biggest take away from this game. Petrovic is without a doubt our number 1.） | | Spanswick77：我对桑切斯没有意见，但我对彼得维奇更有信心。（I don’t mind Sanchez but I feel more confident with Petrovic in goal.） | ord3p：如果我们卖了加拉格尔，我会恨伯利一辈子。（If we sell Gallagher I’ll dedicate the rest of my life on hating Boehly.） | AceQuire：输第七次决赛一定会是不同的感觉。（The 7th cup final defeat gonna hit different） | half_jase：胜利&#x3D;耶！ 表现&#x3D;emmm （The win &#x3D; YAY! The performance &#x3D; Less said the better…） | JJ-Bittenbinder：我知道人们在抱怨我们的比赛方式，但考虑到这场比赛的背景，这是一场非常好的胜利。考虑到我们上周日打了120分钟，并且遭遇了毁灭性的结果。利兹还保持着12场不败，其中有6场连胜。我认为在这种情况下无论如何都赢球都是一个很好的结果。（I know people are complaining about how we played but looking at this game with context it’s a very good win. Considering we played 120 minutes on Sunday and had a devastating result. Leeds also has been unbeaten in 12 games with a 6 game win streak. I think a win in any way is a great result considering the circumstances）"},{"title":"Chelsea-Reddit-Comment-vsLiverpool-Carabao_Cup","date":"2024-02-28T10:45:23.000Z","path":"2024/02/28/Chelsea-Reddit-Comment-vsLiverpool-Carabao-Cup/","text":"Post-Match Thread: Chelsea (0) - (1) Liverpool | English Carabao Cup DrCrazyFishMan1：输给一帮15岁的小孩，然后再来把我们失败的原因归结到我们的年龄？别逗了。 browncheesestick：更应该去责怪教练和他的怂逼战术。最后45分钟我简直大吃一斤。 Thisty：我们应该在加时赛暴打利物浦。但波嗨却直接让我们坐下。 epicmarc：他认为跟那些小年轻踢点球胜算很大。我真想给他两拳。 marktbde：最后三十分钟确实是这样。我们明明在常规时间的最后十分钟掌控着比赛，结果我们莫名其妙的在加时赛变得被动，还反过来给了利物浦赢比赛的信心。 我一直是对波切蒂诺执教切尔西保持乐观态度的人，并且也原谅过他的一些迷惑决定。但是让球员们放弃球权低位防守是我们输球的原因。他是个彻彻底底的失败者。 FabsMagicHat：这场比赛让我意识到，跟着波切蒂诺，我们什么都不会赢下。这么好的机会，这可能是这赛季最重要的比赛，你都不能拿下，还让利物浦的年轻球员在比赛中渐入佳境。 brandonpeate：彼得罗维奇今晚是站着输的。两边的门将都贡献了伟大的表演。 Medical_Seaweed5003：他今晚很棒。 PR35t0nGArvEy：同意。彼得罗维奇是我们门将位置上的升级。这赛季为数不多积极的消息。 slow_poetry：加时赛面对青年队的表现，简直怂得抽象。 DarkLordOlli：很明显是波嗨的指示。我们每次都要先用差不多十分钟去解决他给我们设置的障碍，然后等下次机会出现时，我们又会回到原来的状态。我们一开始一直长传大脚找雅克松，最后又想拖到点球大战。 他把车子带得太怂了。每次我们有一点势头的时候，他都会把它浇灭。波切蒂诺一日不除，车子一日不得复兴。 chenGuiZhang：我们今天在防守端的表现得就像一支下游球队，看得我恶心。这种恶心的表现，应该让每一个没有意识到问题所在的人，彻底看清现在的切尔西。 不要再说我们逼抢很好了，有什么用？丑陋的低位防守让一群青训球员（指利物浦青训小将）在场上可以像在训练场上一样传球。不仅可悲，而且不可原谅的懦夫行为，把到手的胜利送给了利物浦。 Hannibal09：每次中场休息之后，你都会清楚地看到我们是第二好的球队。我不知道这个卖柠檬的在中场时给他们说了什么，但肯定不是什么积极比赛的话。我真的恨透了这些“热刺式”的基因影响我们的俱乐部。 stirkee：加时的表现真的太烂了。有些球员看起来就跟死人一样。 Business-Conflict435：太烂了。太烂了。 stirkee：我们就是想踢点球。 我完全不理解为什么我们的终结能力能这么差。我们本不该踢加时赛。 Business-Conflict435：想踢点球vs替补全是小孩。 MrCleanandShady：说真的，看到加拉格尔丢了那个单刀之后，我就知道我们会输了。 我是第一次对这种关键比赛感到无所谓，不管发生了什么。 Parezky8：按往常来说，我会感到焦虑。但今年真是没把它当回事。 DANG3R_1204：为什么我每次都要毁掉我的周末？ APeckover27：必须承认这是我看过的最尴尬的决赛失利。 Headlesshorsman02：几乎所有能让我们赢的机会都出现了，但我们还是不能拿下比赛。 doctorweiwei：很难想象穆德里克和马杜埃凯面对一堆体力大量消耗的防守球员，仍然什么都做不到。 范戴克在穆德里克头上得的分。 马杜埃凯浪费了太多机会。 让他们滚蛋吧。 Toxzon：但是另一场比赛，马杜持球在禁区里拿到球，却又故意把球传出去。一点球商都没有。 InLampWeTrust：说实话，穆德里克真的很难评，我认为我们买了个废物。马杜埃凯与他相比更有发展前途。穆德里克跟这些疲劳的球员对抗，但仍然在场上没有存在感。 doctorweiwei：我认为穆德里克现在需要租借去英冠。现在还强留他在队里只是因为买他用了太多的钱，毕竟这是沉没成本。 NijjioN：穆德里克23了，看起来他还需要租借两个赛季去提升他的球商。 用那么大的价钱卖他真的太失败了。 甘霖娘傻x管理层。太业余了。 Sure_Explanation2254：这个进球最让人生气的是，你知道他们的战术，但是你就是什么都做不了。 CaptLeaderLegend26：他们用三队打了一个简单的“范戴克和因沙拉”（指依靠强壮的防守球员，一种简单粗暴的战术）就奏效了。 Nick33raps：我已经在等标题是“波切蒂诺依然得到管理层支持”的文章了。 shastmak4：真tm可悲。输给一支u21。一个又一个绝佳进球机会，就是没人能把握住。 不能想象切尔西能在过去的25年里以如此小丑的方式输掉一场决赛。利物浦大概在80分钟就已经举白旗了，然后让他们一线队的球员下场休息。 这不是切尔西。真令人尴尬。他们应该为这件事受到数月的指责。 BigAssBreadroll：从这场比赛就能看出，一个好的教练能为一支球队带去什么。总是用切尔西球员很年轻这种借口是站不住脚的。 Leuchtrakete：我第一次知道，同时感到愤怒和无所谓是什么感觉。谢谢切尔西，谢谢波切蒂诺。 Kagoshima_Luke：有人能通知一下恩昆库我们是在踢决赛吗？他在场上就是在散步，从他的表情里也看不出求胜的欲望。 Glass_Ride312：我同意，他看起来真的很无所谓。 Stand_On_It：他可能在想他为什么要来切尔西。 GladMathematician645：我们可以像FIFA那样模拟赛季剩余的比赛吗？ glacialOwl：开始期待周中的文章和训练里的笑脸照片。 eggsbenedict17：穆德里克花了我们6000磅？恩佐花了我们超过一亿磅？我简直不敢相信。 Tucsonschalke04fan：如果我说穆德里克是取代了普利希奇的位置，你又该如何应对？我们到底是如何得出穆德里克比普利希奇更好的？ eggsbenedict17：我相信这就是战争补偿，穆德里克就不是英超水平的球员。 kingfosa13：不要忘了在我们买断恩佐之前，他以一千万欧的价格转会到了本菲卡。 epicmarc：让这个懦弱的热刺loser滚出我们的俱乐部。 LegendaryMolerat：换上查洛巴对我来说就是死亡宣告。我知道我们会输，就是不知道会怎么输。最后几乎和曼城平局一样的剧本。 robertangier2096：英雄所见略同，我们就不能在这种重要的比赛里上查洛巴，波嗨到底在想什么？ krenshaw420：快把兰八端上来罢。"},{"title":"blog_building","date":"2024-02-27T13:32:08.000Z","path":"2024/02/27/blog-building/","text":"整体框架主页博客预览 标签页面根据标签分类博客 时间线根据博客创建时间来展示博客 博客总览页面（编辑\\删除博客）在线编辑博客"},{"title":"Chelsea-Reddit-Comment-vsCrystalPalace-240213","date":"2024-02-15T04:04:39.000Z","path":"2024/02/15/Chelsea-Reddit-Comment-vsCrystalPalace-240213/","text":"Post-Match Thread: Crystal Palace (1) vs (3) Chelsea | English Premier League kjmer：No more wasting Palmer up top, he was so much more involved on the right。 帕尔默踢前锋就是隐身，他在右路才能更好地参与进攻。 graejx：On the other hand we barely saw nkunku, staying up top is tough for getting any balls. 车子的前锋就是坐牢位，让昆昆在前锋他也很难拿到球。 kjmer：He was making those runs though, he drags a defender away on both goals i’m pretty sure 他跑动非常积极，基本上每个进球他都有牵走几个防守球员。 XzibitABC：He did, and he largely did well to maintain possession and pass when he did get the couple a couple times.
